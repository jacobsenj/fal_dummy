# TYPO3 - EXT:fal_dummy

Install the extension and switch the LocalDriver to the LocalDummyDriver to get valid images for missing files.

You can also use the extension to get dummy files. Just create a LocalStorage to relative folder: "typo3conf/ext/fal_dummy/Resources/Public/Dummy/" (Note: Please unset the "writeable" checkbox to avoid temp files in the extension directory)
